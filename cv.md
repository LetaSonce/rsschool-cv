## Code Examples

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/your-work) | [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/LetaSonce)

**DESCRIPTION:**
You are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.
"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

**Example**

`alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")`

Should return `"20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )`

**Solution**

```javascript
function alphabetPosition(text) {
  const result = text.split('').map(a => parseInt(a, 36) - 9)
        .filter(a => a >= +1).join(' ')

  return result;
}
